## Complexity Analysis

This project implements various algorithms, including **DFS** for water flow simulation and **Merge Sort** for score management. Below is the complexity analysis for these algorithms in the context of our game's terrain generation and levels.

### **DFS Algorithm:**

The DFS (Depth First Search) algorithm is used to simulate water flow through the terrain. The terrain is represented as a 3D grid of stacks, with each stack having a height. The algorithm explores all possible directions (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) to find a path from the origin to the drain.

**Time Complexity**
1. **Best Case**: \(O(V)\)
   - **Scenario**: The path from the origin to the drain is direct (no height mismatches).
   - The algorithm finds the solution with minimal exploration.

2. **Average Case**: \(O(V + E)\)
   - **Scenario**: The path involves several turns, and some backtracking is required.
   - DFS explores parts of the terrain but prunes unnecessary branches.

3. **Worst Case**: \(O(V + E)\)
   - **Scenario**: The terrain has no direct path, requiring the algorithm to explore nearly the entire grid.
   - The algorithm explores most paths due to backtracking.

**Where:**
- V = Number of cells in the grid (rows Ã— columns).
- E = Edges connecting the cells (up to 8 edges per cell for diagonals.

**Merge Sort Algorithm:**

The Merge Sort algorithm is used to sort scores in descending order. It works by recursively dividing the input array into halves, sorting each half, and merging them back together.

**Time Complexity**
1. **Best Case**: \(O(n(log n)\)
   - **Scenario**: Scores are already sorted in descending order.
   - Even in the best case, merge sort divides the array and performs comparisons during merging.

2. **Average Case**: \(O(n(log n)\)
   - **Scenario**: Scores are in random order.
   - The algorithm performs consistent comparisons and merges at all levels of recursion.

3. **Worst Case**: \(O(n(log n)\)
   - **Scenario**: Scores are sorted in ascending order (reverse of desired order).
   - Merge Sort's performance remains unaffected by the input's order.

**Where:**
- n = Number of scores to be sorted.


### **Comparison of Algorithms**

| Algorithm       | Best Case       | Average Case    | Worst Case      | Use Case                     |
|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------------------|
| **DFS**         | \(O(V)\)        | \(O(V + E)\)    | \(O(V + E)\)    | Water flow simulation        |
| **Merge Sort**  | \(O(n(log n)\) | \(O(n(log n)\) | \(O(n(log n)\) | Sorting scores in descending |
