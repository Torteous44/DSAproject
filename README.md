### **File Breakdown**

Below is an overview of the key files and their respective roles in the game:

#### 1. **`assets` Directory**  
Contains all the media resources used in the game:
- **"images" Folder**: Stores the images for the game, including the drain and water faucet visuals.
- **"sounds" Folder**: Holds sound files for in-game audio effects.

#### 2. **`src` Directory**  
This folder contains the core game logic and utilities.

**Core Files (`core`):**
- **audio.py**: Manages the playback of sound effects during gameplay.
- **display.py**: Handles the graphical rendering of the game, including the grid and visual elements.
- **gameplay.py**: Contains the logic for playing a specific level, including terrain manipulation and water flow simulation.
- **menu.py**: Responsible for generating and managing the main menu screen.
- **settings.py**: Defines the game settings such as screen size, level configurations, and terrain layout.
- **simulation.py**: Implements the **Depth First Search (DFS)** algorithm to simulate water flow across the grid.
- **terrain.py**: Handles the generation of the terrain matrix, including stack heights that define the landscape for each level.

**Utility Files (`utils`):**
- **end_of_level.py**: Manages the end-of-level screen and displays the results when a player completes a level.
- **score_manager.py**: Calculates and updates the player’s score, and sorts scores using the **Merge Sort** algorithm.

#### 3. **tests.py**  
This file contains various code snippets and functions designed for testing different features and mechanics of the game.

### Other Files:
- **`.idea` Folder**

The `.idea` folder is generated by JetBrains IDEs (e.g., PyCharm) and contains IDE-specific settings like project structure, inspections, and version control configurations. It is not crucial to the project’s functionality and is ignored using `.gitignore`.

- **`main.py`**
  
The entry point for the game. It initializes the game, loads the main menu, and allows the player to select levels. It also calls the relevant gameplay functions and handles transitions between levels and menus.

- **`scores.json`**

A JSON file that stores player scores for each level. It is updated dynamically during gameplay to save high scores and maintain rankings.

## Complexity Analysis

This project implements various algorithms, including **DFS** for water flow simulation and **Merge Sort** for score management. Below is the complexity analysis for these algorithms in the context of our game's terrain generation and levels.

### **DFS Algorithm:**

The DFS (Depth First Search) algorithm is used to simulate water flow through the terrain. The terrain is represented as a 3D grid of stacks, with each stack having a height. The algorithm explores all possible directions (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) to find a path from the origin to the drain.

**Time Complexity**
1. **Best Case**: \(O(V)\)
   - **Scenario**: The path from the origin to the drain is direct (no height mismatches).
   - The algorithm finds the solution with minimal exploration.

2. **Average Case**: \(O(V + E)\)
   - **Scenario**: The path involves several turns, and some backtracking is required.
   - DFS explores parts of the terrain but eliminates unnecessary branches.

3. **Worst Case**: \(O(V + E)\)
   - **Scenario**: The terrain has no direct path, requiring the algorithm to explore nearly the entire grid.
   - The algorithm explores most paths due to backtracking.

**Where:**
- V = Number of cells in the grid (rows × columns).
- E = Edges connecting the cells (up to 8 edges per cell for diagonals).

### **Merge Sort Algorithm:**

The Merge Sort algorithm is used to sort scores in descending order. It works by recursively dividing the input array into halves, sorting each half, and merging them back together.

**Time Complexity**
1. **Best Case**: \(O(n(log n)\)
   - **Scenario**: Scores are already sorted in descending order.
   - Even in the best case, merge sort divides the array and performs comparisons during merging.

2. **Average Case**: \(O(n(log n)\)
   - **Scenario**: Scores are in random order.
   - The algorithm performs consistent comparisons and merges at all levels of recursion.

3. **Worst Case**: \(O(n(log n)\)
   - **Scenario**: Scores are sorted in ascending order (reverse of desired order).
   - Merge Sort's performance remains unaffected by the input's order.

**Where:**
- n = Number of scores to be sorted.


### **Comparison of Algorithms**

| Algorithm       | Best Case       | Average Case    | Worst Case      | Use Case                     |
|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------------------|
| **DFS**         | \(O(V)\)        | \(O(V + E)\)    | \(O(V + E)\)    | Water flow simulation        |
| **Merge Sort**  | \(O(n(log n)\) | \(O(n(log n)\) | \(O(n(log n)\) | Sorting scores in descending |
